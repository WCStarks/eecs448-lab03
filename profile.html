        <p class="textbox"> <b>Description:</b> A foam chicken that my roommate got at the career fair. He says that it was uncomfortable to carry in his pocket for the rest of the fair, but it was worth it in the end because he likes the chicken. The chicken has no name and has been residing under our coffee table without paying rent for some time now. <br> <br>
